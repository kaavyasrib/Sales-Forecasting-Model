# Sales Forecasting Model

## Overview
This project creates an end-to-end sales forecasting pipeline using ARIMA modeling in Python. It generates sample time series data (or use your own), fits a model, forecasts future sales, and visualizes results for operational insights.

## Setup
1. Clone the repo: `git clone https://github.com/yourusername/sales-forecasting-model.git`
2. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Run the script: `python sales_forecasting_model.py`

## Features
- Time series data processing with Pandas
- Automated forecasting using ARIMA (regression-based statistical methodology)
- Visualization of historical data and forecasts with Matplotlib
- Optional: Replace sample data with real CSV from Kaggle (e.g., https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rohitsahoo/sales-forecasting)

## Output
- Printed forecast values
- Saved plot in `output/` folder

## Relevance
Showcases building and maintaining forecasting models, using data/metrics for insights, and supporting process improvements in sales/operations.
